Coffee Shops Sales Dashboard

This dashboard presents insights to the regional manager of a coffee chain with three stores. The goal is to provide actionable insights to optimize operations across the stores.

# Key Highlights:
Revenue Growth: Revenue has shown a consistent upward trend, reflecting positive business growth.
Busiest Days: Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays experience the highest footfall, aligning with the workweek trend when people are energized and prefer coffee breaks.
Busiest Hours: Morning hours are the peak times, as customers frequent the coffee shops on their way to work.

# Top Insights:
Best-Selling Product: The top category is coffee, with Barista Espresso being the most popular product across all stores.
Low-Performing Products: Certain flavors, coffee beans, and merchandise items show lower sales. For instance, merchandise clothing sales at the Astoria store are significantly lower than in other stores.

# Data-Driven Recommendations:
Discount Strategies: Introduce discounts or promotional offers on low-performing products at the Astoria store to boost sales.
Inventory Optimization: Consider limiting in-store display of underperforming products, like merchandise clothing, and shift to an online order-only model. This can help reduce operational costs.
